# Particle-Simulator
This is a Java application for simulating particles on a 1280x720 canvas. Features include adding an explorer/sprite that navigates the canvas and renders the periphery of the explorer in terms of the other particles moving nearby, adding particles individually or in batches, real-time interaction through a GUI, and efficient parallel processing.  STDISCM Group 4.

## How to Use: Press E to Change Modes
### Introducing the Explorer Mode
This mode is used for activating the sprite and navigating to wherever desired in the canvas. The sprite is centered within the screen and uses a grid perspective in terms of rendering nearby particles in a zoomed layout.

### Movement of Sprite
The movement of the Sprite is simply done by using the arrow keys in your keyboard.
